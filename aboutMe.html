            <p>Let's get to know each other! Some facts about me ... </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am from the San Francisco Bay Area.</li>
                <li>I LOVE breakfast foods - those are blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes from my favorite brunch place Avalon in Ann Arbor!</li>
                <li>My dogs are my favorite thing in the world. Chloe is the Jack Russell Terrier and Nika is the miniature Husky. They are both huge Michigan fans and love Halloween.</li>
                <li>My favorite place is Lake Tahoe. My friends and I like to ski there in the winter and take a boat out on the lake in the summer.</li>
